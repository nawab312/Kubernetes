**Service Discovery**
- Kubernetes provides service discovery through its *DNS (Domain Name System)* and *Kubernetes Services* mechanism.

*DNS-Based Discovery*
- Each Kubernetes Service gets a DNS name within the cluster (e.g., `my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`).
- When a pod wants to communicate with a service, it simply uses the service's DNS name, and Kubernetes resolves this to the appropriate set of pods backing the service.
- The DNS server within the cluster is managed by *CoreDNS* (or kube-dns in earlier versions), which provides internal name resolution.

*Service Abstraction:*
- A Kubernetes Service acts as a stable endpoint for a set of pods, abstracting away the actual pod IPs (which can change over time due to scaling or pod restarts).
- Kubernetes keeps track of the available pods for each service through labels and selectors, ensuring the service always points to the right set of pods.

**For Headless Service**
- A headless service is created by setting clusterIP: None.
- Unlike a normal ClusterIP service, it does not allocate a virtual IP.
- Instead of routing traffic through kube-proxy, DNS queries for a headless service return the actual IPs of the matching Pods.
- Kubernetes automatically creates DNS records for each Pod. These are fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) that always resolve to the correct Pod, even across restarts or reschedules.
```bash
db-0.db.data.svc.cluster.local
db-1.db.data.svc.cluster.local
```

**Load Balancing**

*Server-Side Load Balancing (Kubernetes Service - ClusterIP):*
- In server-side load balancing, a load balancer (like kube-proxy) sits in the middle and distributes traffic to available backend Pods.
- When you access a Kubernetes Service (e.g., `my-svc.default.svc.cluster.loca`l), kube-proxy or IPVS or IP Tables acts as the load balancer and routes the traffic to the Pods that match the Service's selector.
- How it works:
 - The client sends a request to the Service's ClusterIP (which is a virtual IP).
 - kube-proxy intercepts the request and forwards it to one of the available Pods (backend containers), based on the load balancing algorithm (round-robin, least connections, etc.).

*Client-Side Load Balancing (Headless Service with Pods):*
- In client-side load balancing, the client itself decides how to distribute the traffic to Pods, often using multiple Pod IPs returned by CoreDNS (with a headless Service).
- When you access a headless service, CoreDNS returns all available Pod IPs for the service.
- The client (application or library) then has to decide which Pod to connect to.

How does Kubernetes handle pod-to-pod communication across nodes
- **CNI (Container Network Interface)** – How Kubernetes assigns IPs to pods and enables networking across nodes.
- **Kube-Proxy** – How Kubernetes manages services and routes traffic efficiently.
- **Kubernetes DNS** – How internal pod-to-pod and service discovery happens dynamically.

By combining *CNI for pod IP allocation*, *kube-proxy for service routing*, and *Kubernetes DNS for discovery*, Kubernetes ensures that pod-to-pod communication remains seamless, even when pods are rescheduled or replaced.

**CNI (Container Network Interface) – How Pods Get IPs and Communicate Across Nodes**
- Kubernetes does not have a built-in networking solution; instead, it relies on CNI plugins to handle pod networking. Each pod gets a unique IP address from the CNI plugin, making inter-pod communication
- How CNI Works:
  - When a pod is created, the CNI plugin assigns it an IP address from the cluster’s network.
  - The plugin ensures that all pods, across all nodes, can communicate without NAT (Network Address Translation). This is achieved through Overlay Networking (e.g., Flannel, Calico VXLAN) or Routing-based Networking (e.g., Calico BGP, Cilium).
  - CNI sets up the necessary network routes on each node so that traffic can reach any pod, regardless of which node it runs on.

**Kube-Proxy – How Kubernetes Manages Traffic for Services**
- While CNI handles raw pod IP communication, kube-proxy ensures traffic routing and load balancing for Kubernetes Services.
- How kube-proxy Works:
  - Each Kubernetes Service gets a ClusterIP (virtual IP).
  - kube-proxy updates iptables (or IPVS rules) to forward service traffic to the correct pod.
  - When a pod behind a service dies and is replaced, kube-proxy updates the routing rules dynamically.

**Kubernetes DNS – How Pods Discover Other Pods and Services**
- Pods don’t usually communicate directly via IP addresses. Instead, they use Kubernetes DNS for service discovery.
- How Kubernetes DNS Works:
  - Each Kubernetes Service gets a DNS name: `service-name.namespace.svc.cluster.local`
  - When a pod queries this DNS name, it gets the ClusterIP of the service.
  - The service forwards traffic to healthy pods.

**Pod-to-Pod Communication Across Nodes – Step-by-Step Flow**
- *Pod Creation & IP Assignment (CNI)*
  - A new Pod A is scheduled on Node 1.
  - The CNI plugin assigns Pod A a unique IP.
  - Networking routes are updated to ensure Pod A can communicate with other pods.
- *Pod-to-Pod Communication (CNI Routing)*
  - Pod A (Node 1) wants to talk to Pod B (Node 2).
  - The CNI plugin on Node 1 routes or encapsulates the packet and forwards it to Node 2.
  - The CNI plugin on Node 2 decapsulates and delivers the packet to Pod B.
- *Service Communication & Load Balancing (kube-proxy)*
  - If Pod A contacts Service B, it sends traffic to Service B’s ClusterIP.
  - kube-proxy intercepts and forwards traffic to a healthy pod behind Service B.
- *Service Discovery (Kubernetes DNS)*
  - Instead of IPs, Pod A uses DNS (e.g., `service-b.default.svc.cluster.local`).
  - Kubernetes DNS resolves it to Service B’s ClusterIP.
  - Traffic flows through kube-proxy to reach an available Pod B.

**If a network policy is implemented to block traffic, will nslookup still happen?**
- Yes, `nslookup` will still work even if a NetworkPolicy blocks Pod-to-Pod traffic. Here's why:
- `nslookup` talks to CoreDNS, which runs as a separate Service (usually in the kube-system namespace).
- Unless there’s a NetworkPolicy blocking DNS (UDP 53), the DNS query will succeed.
- But when the Pod tries to connect to the Service (ClusterIP), if ingress or egress traffic is blocked by NetworkPolicy, the actual connection will fail, even though DNS worked.
