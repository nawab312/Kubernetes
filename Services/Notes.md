A Service in Kubernetes provides a way to expose your application running inside a set of Pods. We cannot scale a Kubernetes Service. **Endpoint** is an object that represents the IP addresses (Including Port) of the Pods that are dynamically assigned to a Service. It helps in routing traffic to the correct Pod(s) backing a Service.
