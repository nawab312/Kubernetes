- **metadata**
  - `name` Name of the PVC
  - `namespace` The Kubernetes namespace
  - `labels` Tags for the PVC, useful for identifying the PVC across clusters or environments.
- **spec**
  - `accessModes`
    - In the PV, the accessModes field defines how the volume can be accessed by the Kubernetes cluster. This is a property of the physical storage resource itself (the volume), and it describes the *capabilities* of the volume based on the underlying storage system.
    - In the PVC, the accessModes field defines how the user or workload wants to access the volume. It is part of the claim that describes the *desired access mode* for the volume. 
  - `resources.requests.storage`: Defines the requested storage amount. This is set to 50Gi in this case.
  - `storageClassName` Specifies which storage class to use for the PVC. In this example, the fast-storage class is used.
  - `volumeMode` Defines the mode of the volume. It could either be Filesystem (default) or Block
  - `selector` Used to match specific volumes with labels, typically to find specific Persistent Volumes (PVs) with certain criteria.
  - `volumeName` The specific Persistent Volume to bind to. If not specified, Kubernetes will look for a PV that satisfies the claimâ€™s requirements.
  - `dataSource` Optionally, you can define a dataSource to create the PVC from an existing backup, snapshot, or another PVC.
  - `fsType` Specifies the filesystem type. ext4 is commonly used for Linux-based systems.
