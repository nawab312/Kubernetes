### What is KEDA? ###
- KEDA (Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling) is an extension for Kubernetes that allows you to scale workloads based on external event sources, not just CPU/memory.
- By default, Kubernetes uses the **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** which scales based on:
  - CPU
  - Memory
  - Custom metrics (if configured)
- KEDA enhances this by:
  - Watching external systems (Kafka, SQS, Prometheus, Azure Queue, etc.)
  - Converting those metrics into Kubernetes metrics
  - Automatically scaling pods up or down
  - Even scaling to zero
- **HPA = Resource-Based Scaling**
- **KEDA = Event-Based Scaling**
